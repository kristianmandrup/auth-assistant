# Design and plans for the future...

1) Specs for generators
Currently there are a few generators. I have found some good examples of how to write generator tests (using test_unit) in the rails3-generators project.
I am porting this to RSpec 2 and will then write generator specs next.

2) New hook-in approach for controller and view methods
I will change how the methods are added to Rails controllers and views using a new approach I found and used in the Netzke project.

3) Create specs for the custom methods
4) Create cucumber features for various Role scenarios
5) Add Mongoid and Mongo Mapper ORM support
Mongoid currently supported by Devise, and Mongo Mapper will be supported after Rails 3 release I think (have heard?)

6) Add Data Mapper support
dm-devise project almost done by jm81 as per. July 9, 2010

7) Add support for Canable (jnunemaker), an even simpler permission system alternative to CanCan.
I already added generators and specs to this gem.

Feel free to suggest other improvements etc ;)
