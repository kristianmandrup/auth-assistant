# Auth-Assistant

This project aims to assist you in setting up a complete user login and role permission system for your Rails 3 app.
It targets [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) as the Session system, [CanCan](http://github.com/ryanb/cancan) as the permission system and 
[Roles](http://github.com/kristianmandrup/roles_generic) as the user Roles system. 

The objective of this project is to 
* Integrate all these subsystems in a powerful, yet flexible solution. 
* Provide a generator that can auto-configure your Rails 3 app with these sub-systems for a given ORM

# Important update!

This project has been renamed and replaced with a new project called [Cream](http://github.com/kristianmandrup/cream)
