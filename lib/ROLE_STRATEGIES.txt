*Auth assistant* supports single and multiple role strategies. Currently groups are not supported. 

Note: Maybe roles support could be integrated in the future using an existing solution for roles and groups? 

h2. Single role per user

* admin_field 
* role_field (role : string in users table)
* role_assignment (role_id -> role.id)

h3. admin_field
Uses the field *admin : boolean* in the _users_ table

h3. role_field
Uses the field *role : string* in the _users_ table

h3. role_assignment
Uses the field *role_id :integer* in the _users_ table. 
A _roles_ table has id and name fields, where name is the name of the role.
`users.role_id` points to `role.id` in a 1-M relation. 

Many (M) users can have the same (1) role. Any user can however only have a single role.

h2. Multiple roles per user
* roles mask
* roles_field 
* multi_role_assignment

h3. roles mask
Uses the field *role_masks : integer* in the _users_ table.
Each bit of the integer matches a given role.

h3. roles_field
Uses the field *roles : string* in the _users_ table.
Currently "experimental".

h3. multi_role_assignment
Uses the field *role_assignment_id : integer* in the _users_ table.
A _roles_ table has id and name fields, where name is the name of the role.
A _role_assignments_ table has _role_id_ and _user_id_ fields, linking the assignment to a user in the users table and a role in the roles table.
