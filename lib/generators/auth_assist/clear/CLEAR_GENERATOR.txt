The *clear* generator removes an existing role strategy and optionally generates a migration to revert the database to a state without this role strategy.

This generator allows you to easily change role strategy: 
1. run the *clear* generator to clear an existing role strategy
2. run the *config* generator to configure the app with a new role strategy.

<pre>$ rails g auth_assist:clear NAME</pre>

Example usage:
<pre>$ rails g auth_assist:clear role_field</pre>
